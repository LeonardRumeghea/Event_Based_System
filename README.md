# Event_Based_System

# Parallelization
* Within the application, threads were used for parallelization. For the generation of subscriptions and publications, the number of objects that must be generated by each thread was divided equally.
* Especially for subscriptions, the number of elements that must contain certain fields was calculated a priori based on the percentages given as a parameter and distributed to each thread.

# Testing
* The tests were run on an Intel core i7-13700H processor, with 14 cores and 20 logical processors, with 32 GB of DDR5 RAM available.
